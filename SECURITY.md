## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At Blink Labs, we take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our projects, please report it responsibly to help us protect our users and the community.

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please email us at [security@blinklabs.io](mailto:security@blinklabs.io) with the following information:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 7 days indicating our next steps. We will keep you informed about the progress towards a fix and may ask for additional information.

Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will publicly disclose it after giving you credit (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep Blink Labs and the open source community secure!
